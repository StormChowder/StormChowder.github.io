    <h1 id="history" class='header'>History</h1>
    <p>I am a 30 year old mother of two. I work full time as a veterinary technician. In early 2021, I was looking for a new hobby 
        and stumbled upon Codecademy again. I had attempted to code in the past, with little patience and little success.
        <br><br>This time, though, I fell in love.<br><br>
        I'm fascinated and enthralled by the simplicity of coding languages, and the ability to <em>create</em> out of empty space.
        Additionally, the speed at which the entirety of technology as we know it has improved is astounding.</p>
    <h1 id="languages" class='header'>Languages</h1>
    <p>I am currently learning the following languages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I hope to continue to learn things that sound cool like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
            <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
    <p>I am currently focused on front end development due to my level of completion in Codecademy, 
        but will be moving to back end development soon. I hope to be a full stack developer by the end of the year!
        I would love to learn things to be able to enhance my online TTRPGs, or to build video games some day!</p>
    <h1 id="skills" class='header'>Other Skills</h1>
        <p>In my daily life as a wife, mother, and veterinary technician, I have gained many skills, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Dodging poop</li>
                <li>Not getting bitten</li>
                <li>Snuggles</li>
                <li>Multitasking</li>
                <li>Stress management</li>
